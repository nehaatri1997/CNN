# CNN

This Python script, cnn.py, is designed to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification tasks. The CNN model is implemented using libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, providing a robust framework for recognizing patterns in image data.

# Features
1. CNN Architecture: Builds a CNN model with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected layers.
2. Image Preprocessing: Performs standard image preprocessing like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: Trains the CNN on labeled image data, validates it on a separate dataset, and evaluates its accuracy.
4. Save and Load Model: Includes functionality to save the trained model and reload it for future predictions.

# Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
1. tensorflow or keras for building and training the CNN
2. numpy for numerical operations
3. matplotlib for visualizations (optional, if visualizations are included)

To install the required packages, run:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

# Usage
1. Prepare the Data: Organize your image data into train and validation sets. Ensure your images are labeled correctly in separate directories, e.g., data/train/class1, data/train/class2.

2. Run the Script:
python cnn.py
3. Output: The script will output training metrics, validation accuracy, and loss at each epoch. It may also display evaluation metrics like accuracy and loss on the test dataset.

# Example Workflow
1. Building the Model: The CNN model typically includes several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully-connected layers.
2. Training: The script uses a specified number of epochs and batch size for training. It may include data augmentation to improve model generalization.
3. Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, and the results are printed or visualized.

# Customization
To customize the CNN architecture or training parameters:
1. Open cnn.py in a text editor.
2. Modify model parameters like the number of layers, filter sizes, or activation functions.
3. Adjust training parameters such as epochs and batch_size to optimize performance.

Example Output
The script may produce outputs such as:

1. Training and Validation Loss/Accuracy over epochs
2. Confusion Matrix and Classification Report for test data evaluation
3. Sample Predictions with actual and predicted labels (if included in the script)

# Model Saving and Loading
The script can save the trained model to a file, which allows for future use without retraining. To save a model:
model.save("cnn_model.h5")

To load the saved model:
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("cnn_model.h5")
